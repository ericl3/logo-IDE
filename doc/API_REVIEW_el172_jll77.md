## Part 1
1. Adding new features into our API design should be flexible in terms of internal front-end API. adding new features
and adding languages is flexible because we use property files and reflection. The backend should be flexible given that
subclasses will be properly distributed so that adding a new class would be extremely easy or new language.

2. We have a controller to handle communication between backend and front end. The backend does not depend on the front-end
but the front-end can depend on back-end.

3. On front-end entering the wrong command. If wrong command, catch and show a popup of wrong command.

4. Our API design is flexible and ensures that we use proper MVC protocol to ensure that the backend and the front-end are separate

## Part 2
1. Using model view controller as an idea to integrate front end and back end together.

2. Creating the interface needed for the MVC

3. The abstract syntax tree for command parsing.

4. turtle moves forward 50, should be able to generate on screen, or any sort of directional change.
 - parsing multiple nested commands
 - figuring out communication between updating the backend and front end
 - changing colors.
